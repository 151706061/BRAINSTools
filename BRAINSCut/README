*BRAINSCut Description with respect to the BRAINSTools AutoWorkUp Pipeline.*

The resulting data set of bias-corrected average T1 and/or T2 images from BRAINSABC are subsequently segmented for subcortical structures using an automated segmentation framework, BRAINSCut. BRAINSCut is an extension of previous works that employs robust random forest machine learning that has been validated on multi-site MR data (Kim, Magnotta, Liu, & Johnson, 2014). The subcortical structures of interest include accumben, caudate, putamen, hippocampus, and thalamus. The result of this procedure were again visually inspected and resulted in a success rate greater than 90%. All the development processing was blinded to clinical data, such as HD gene-expansion status, gender, and age.
