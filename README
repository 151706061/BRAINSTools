The BRAINSTools is a harness to assist in building the many
BRAINSTools under development.

Developers should run the "./Utilities/SetupForDevelopment.sh" script to get started.

## Building ##
Example session for a clean build:
mkdir ~/src/mytester
cd ~/src/mytester
git clone git://github.com/BRAINSia/BRAINSTools.git
cd BRAINSTools/
bash ./Utilities/SetupForDevelopment.sh
mkdir -p ../BRAINSTools-build
cd ../BRAINSTools-build/
CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.2 ccmake ../BRAINSTools -DUSE_BRAINSFit:BOOL=ON -DUSE_BRAINSConstellationDetector:BOOL=ON -DUSE_BRAINSABC:BOOL=ON
make -j24 -k ; ## NOTE:  The fetching of data still has problems with parallel builds, so we need to restart it a efw times
make
make
make

## Testing ##
BRAINSTools_MAX_TEST_LEVEL adjusts how agressive the test suite is
so that long running tests or incomplete tests can easily be
silenced
1 - Run the absolute minimum very fast tests (These should always pass before any code commit)
3 - Run fast tests on continous builds (These need immediate attention if they begin to fail)
5 - Run moderate nightly tests (These need immediate attention if they begin to fail)
7 - Run long running extensive test that are a burden to normal development (perhaps test 1x per week)
8 - Run tests that fail due to incomplete test building, these are good ideas for test that we don't have time to make robust)
9 - Run silly tests that don't have much untility
set(BRAINSTools_MAX_TEST_LEVEL 3 CACHE STRING "Testing level for managing test burden")
