The BRAINSTools is a harness to assist in building the many of the BRAINSTools under development.

Developers should run the "./Utilities/SetupForDevelopment.sh" script to get started.


Example session for a clean build:
mkdir ~/src/mytester
cd ~/src/mytester
git clone git://github.com/BRAINSia/BRAINSTools.git
cd BRAINSTools/
bash ./Utilities/SetupForDevelopment.sh
mkdir -p ../BRAINSTools-build
cd ../BRAINSTools-build/
CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.2 ccmake ../BRAINSTools \
-DUSE_BRAINSConstellationDetector:BOOL=ON \
-DUSE_BRAINSABC:BOOL=ON
## NOTE: If you are using a version of Python different from the system default, CMake will ignore your
##       environment variables.  To ensure CMake points to the right version, you need to set the
##       following variables as well:
## -DCMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH:PATH=/path/to/python/bin \
## -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH=/path/to/python/lib \
## -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/path/to/python/include
make -j24 -k ;
## NOTE: The fetching of data still has problems with parallel builds, so we need to restart it at least
#        once
make
